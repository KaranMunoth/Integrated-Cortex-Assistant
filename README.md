# ü§ñ Integrated Assistant

An AI-powered assistant that integrates multiple domain-specific agents (like Collections, Disputes, AR, and FOMC) to provide intelligent insights and responses through a conversational interface. Built on top of Snowflake Cortex, Streamlit, and custom agent frameworks.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Prerequisites**  
Before using this repository, please **set up and configure** the following repositories:

1. [`FOMC_CORTEX_CHATBOT`](https://github.com/KaranMunoth/FOMC_CORTEX_CHATBOT)  
   Enables FOMC-related query handling via semantic search and contextual AI.

2. [`Cortex_Analyst_Chatbot`](https://github.com/KaranMunoth/Cortex_Analyst_Chatbot)  
   Powers the backend with Snowflake Cortex Analyst APIs for semantic querying and chart generation.

These projects are dependencies and must be initialized before running the integrated assistant.

-- Switch to a role that has the authority to grant privileges
USE ROLE ACCOUNTADMIN;

-- Set the context to the correct database and schema
USE DATABASE cortex_search_tutorial_db;
USE SCHEMA public;

-- Grant SELECT privileges to allow data access
GRANT SELECT ON TABLE raw_text TO ROLE cortex_user_role;
GRANT SELECT ON TABLE doc_chunks TO ROLE cortex_user_role;

-- Grant USAGE privilege on the Cortex Search service
GRANT USAGE ON CORTEX SEARCH SERVICE fomc_meeting TO ROLE cortex_user_role;

-- (Optional) Verify access
SHOW CORTEX SEARCH SERVICES;
SHOW CORTEX SEARCH SERVICES IN DATABASE cortex_search_tutorial_db;
SHOW CORTEX SEARCH SERVICES IN SCHEMA cortex_search_tutorial_db.public;
SHOW GRANTS TO ROLE cortex_user_role;
SHOW CORTEX SEARCH SERVICES LIKE 'fomc_meeting';
üìå These grants are essential for allowing your integrated assistant to query Cortex Search and access the underlying data. Without these, the application will not return results properly.
